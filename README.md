# HumanaEthica Volunteer Management System Extension - Group 07

## Overview
This document serves as an introduction to my contributions to the HumanaEthica Volunteer Management System, a university project aimed at enhancing the capabilities of a platform that connects social support institutions with volunteers. As part of Group 07, I was tasked with the design and development of Feature 3 (Evaluate Institution) for both parts of the project deliverables, focusing on the server-side (backend) and the client-side (frontend) components.

## Feature 3 - Institution Evaluation by Volunteers
### Objective
The third feature allows volunteers to submit evaluations for institutions they have interacted with. This feature aims to foster transparency and trust between volunteers and institutions, by providing feedback on the experiences and services offered.

### Backend Development
For the server-side implementation, I developed the necessary APIs to enable volunteers to post their reviews of institutions. This involved ensuring data validation, secure endpoints, and appropriate error handling to facilitate a smooth user experience. Moreover, I implemented domain logic ensuring that reviews are insightful and adhere to the constraints set forth in the project requirements.

### Frontend Development
On the client-side, I crafted a user-friendly interface that empowers volunteers to easily submit their evaluations. The interface I developed ensures that volunteers can only review institutions where they have completed activities, aligning with the project's domain rules. I also focused on providing a responsive and accessible design, to cater to the diverse range of users expected to interact with the system.

## Project Context
This project forms part of the Software Engineering curriculum, where the practical application of design patterns, software architecture, and collaborative development are emphasized. My contribution reflects an understanding of these principles and the effective use of version control and team collaboration tools.

## Final Remarks
The collaborative nature of this project allowed for a comprehensive learning experience. It was essential to not only focus on my individual contributions but also to maintain an awareness of the entire system's architecture and the work done by my peers in my group and in the other subgroups.
